for the second pass, when we are trying to figure out what is expected next. We have a
variable with an enum that has stuff like REGISTER, ADDRESS, OPCODE/LABEL, etc, and have an
'expected' variable, and update it based on what we know. also have a previous_opcode variable.


wait. I can always pretty easily figure out if it is legal or expected. Just based on the type of opcode
